## Forecact Finder
Connects to weatherapi and retrieves the projected forecast based off the user provided inputs:

Location: City name or ZIP (the API has other location identifiers that can be used, but these seemed to be the easiest for users).
Number of Days: How many days of forecast to be retrieved (up to 14).

### Uses tkinter for GUI integration.
